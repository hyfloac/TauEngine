# Tau Reflection Generator

A small tool inspired by Unreal Engine's Header Tool for automatically generating reflection information. Currently it's in the very early stages of development, but it does support generating `get` and `set` attributes (`const` and non-`const` pointers).

This uses Clang's LibTooling to help with the parsing. First it has a preprocessor callback that will record every time one of our macros is expanded. The tool will keep track of the source location and will process all of its attributes. Each instance is pushed into a queue. Then later when walking the AST we look at every time a field is declared, check to see if it is after a property macro; if it is we will pop off that macro from the queue, then insert the property into the list of properties for that class, now with the properties name and type. 

After all of the file has been parsed it will generate a new file (currently fixed in the code) which will contain the macro `TAU_GENERATED_BODY(_CLASS)`.  We take the class name as a parameter to prevent compilation errors, if we directly called `TAU_GENERATED_BODY_Test()` then the preprocessor would fail because it can't find that macro, and it's very difficult to generate that macro based on class name before parsing. Thus we use a small hack to have `TAU_GENERATED_BODY(_CLASS)` redirect to `_TAU_GENERATED_BODY_##_CLASS()` after the code has been generated. These class specific macros will contain an entire class, implementing the reflection class, as well as a static function containing a static instance of the new class, and an instance function for getting the class, which will forward its call to the static function.

Attributes have a chance to generated code custom code for each class. They are passed in the entire set of properties and it is their job to find the properties that they need and generate the proper code for them. Currently there is only `get` and `set` attributes implemented.

## Interface

Currently you can use `TAU_PROPERTY()` macros directly before a field declaration and specify `get` and/or `set` in the argument list. At some point in the class you need to call the macro `GENERATED_BODY()`. The class must also be tagged with `TAU_CLASS()`.

After everything's been generated you can either call `GetStaticClass()` on the type or `getClass()` on the instance to get an instance of reflection class. Within that you have a variety of functions at your disposal generated by the various attributes. The current base implementation has a couple of variations on `getProperty(_T* object, const char* propertyName)`, mainly some templates to have the function return a specific type, and some differentiation between `const` and non-`const` data. There is also specific `setProperty` functions that don't let the client read the value.
